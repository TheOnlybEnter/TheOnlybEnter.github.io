    <p class="subheadings"> CSI Project </p>
    <p> This was my first project and it didn't go as expected. I changed the idea like 3 times and was working in Curses.
      <br> Curses however was a new thing so when I look back at this project I regret working in it. Especially since I got used to IGIS. <br>
      Anyways I ended up with this garbage quiz project even though I knew I could've done so much more. It was a basic answer and choose game.
      <br> I did simplify a lot though. There was almost like 300 lines of code originally but went to 179 lines in the end.<br>
      I want to include one example of fixed code. This was the HINT command. When playing the game it considered it wrong even though its a HINT.
      <br> I fixed it by putting it in the condition of when the persons answer was wrong. I also used a lot of true and false in the form of 0's and 1's<br>
      Sadly I could not find the images, but I do have this for reference of the entire project.
