    <div class="textOne">
      I am looking into websites that are under AISD. Their websites give me insight as to what they like. I also like to be simple. I really dislike complicated websites that have all sorts of links and constantly changing links. Just to list some of the essential components I will need; nav-bar, contact link, and apperance. There are so many things to do but my main concern is the code. I would really like minimize and keep files under control.
