    <h1> Optimal Sort Project</h1>

    <div class = "text"> With the help of <a href="https://github.com/AaronB432"> Aaron </a> we were able to make a algorithm for sorting words. So far this algorithm will take each element from the user and assign them to an array. The current algorithm requires for an array to split into two halves and be sorted using the classic bubble sort. Then we merge the two arrays by appending their elements to a new array, which then is also sorted. My next GOAL is to not split it into halves but rather by twos, so we might have 16 elements which will be split into two's resulting in 8 arrays. From there we merge and sort them which will eventually lead to one big array which is then printed. <p> </div>
