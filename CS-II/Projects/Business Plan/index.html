    <h1> Project Bolt </h1>

    <h2> Identity </h2>
    <div class="text">
      Project Bolt is possibly an app or website that is running 24/7 which allows people in the CS related field to connect via video call. Forms will be given out before you enter asking what topic the person needs help with, as well as their langauge. This form helps navigate more easily to a teacher. After the student is done with their call they will be left a form that asks for a rating on the teacher. Such feedback gives an idea of the teacher and thus improves the quality of the app or website. 
    </div>
    <h2> Problem </h2>
    <div class="text">
      As the computer science field grows, people lack understanding of concepts they learn. Many people do this class not knowing how tough it can be and having a qualified teacher can help students better understand topics. One personal problem I experience is being stuck on some code and trying to understand the issue that is causing it. This can take an inexperienced person hours to fix which makes a site that's up 24/7 useful. 
    </div>
    <h2> Solution </h2>
    <div class="text">
      A site that is up 24/7 and has qualified teachers helping.
    </div>
    <h2> Target Market </h2>
    <div class="text">
      Two types of people are our target. One is experienced people in computer science that are well versed. The second is inexperienced learners who seek help fixing and understanding their issue. 
    </div>
    <h2> Competition </h2>
    <div class="text">
      Many would consider this an offbrand of other video apps, such as Zoom. Not only are other video apps available, but websites that document issues related to the students issue also exist. Programiz, W3 Schools, FreeCodeCamp, are all reliable and helpful tools which a student can use. Learners usually learn better when a teacher explains it through a lecture or speech, but these sites have it in text-only and still do an insane job at explaining it thoroughly. So, there is lots of competition. 
    </div>
    <h2> Revanue </h2>
    <div class="text">
      Learners will be charged to use this service, but it'll only be 3.99$. Which is far less compared to some services. 
    </div>
    <h2> Marketing </h2>
    <div class="text">
      We will appeal to learners and teachers through the usage of ads. 
    </div>
    <h2> Expenses </h2>
    <div class="text">
      We will balance our profit by making sure our teachers get the pay they deserve and putting money toward keeping the site up.
    </div>
    <h2> Team/Roles </h2>
    <div class="text">
      There are five roles in general. Learners, Teachers, Admission Officer, Community Management, and Devs. Starting from the least important, learners are there to learn and provide feedback about a teacher. Teachers are their to help learners understand, each teacher has their set of hours. Admission Officer are people who will check on teachers and contiue to recruit qualified teachers, they also have the power to remove learners and teachers. Community management will be checking on feedback about the app and interact with the community. Dev's make plans on how to manage the business and fix any issues reported from community management
    </div>
    <h2> Milestone</h2>
    <div class="text">
      Our first milestone will be to have the site up and running. The second will be to have fixed any bugs or issues we find. The third is to have teachers and learners actually using our site daily. 
    </div>
