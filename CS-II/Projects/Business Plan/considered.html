    <div class="text">
      This is the idea I wish to do if my groups idea fails. It sounds like a simple idea yet very useful. Our current skyward looks outdated and could use some fixing. Which is why I enjoy this idea because no one actually targets this kind problem. I think skyward does keep a really simplistic UI but this is from a student view, but there really is no telling from a teachers perspective currently. So the UI is something to keep, but the design is not. I highly approve this idea and would like to join it if my groups idea fails.

    <div class="text">
      I really like this groups idea but I find it very difficult to understand how you would translate code. There are so many steps to it. It can almost be compared to translating languages except we have all these other small things like names of functions, numbers, variables, really all sorts of things that must be put together to translate into another programming language. I really like this idea but disaprove it because I feel I am dead weight on such a difficult project like this.

    <div class="text">
      This app helps classes take attendance by using a facial recognition program, which improves classroom efficiency and database organization.
      It could however be used in the future if classes get have large amounts of students.
      Like colleges utilize this because lecture halls can have large amounts of people, and for the professor it's just dead weight for them to take attendence continously
      Although this idea could possibly save some time, I dont feel like its neccesary for this current time and we should prioritize other topics instead.

    <div class="text">
      Booking a table sounds great and all but it's only a necessary when the place can only hold so many people. Currently that is not an issue with the Allen Highschool. The only reason this is good is for large groups that can't be contained within a table, but not many of those exist since students schedules vary. So in all it's great for those fancy expensive resturants, but not for a highschool that hasn't gotten to the extremes of overpopulation.

    <div class="text">
      A very solid idea for those who procrastinate. It's an issue always growing, but I think people don't need a schdule. What they really need to do is take their issue and put it 20 feet away from them so that they stop procrastinating.  So, procrastination is preventable even without a schedule. Personally it doesn't appeal to a person like me who very rarely struggles with such an issue. Hence, I reject it.

    <div class="text">
      I appreciate this idea because for those who don't dress well it could be useful. Not everyone takes the time to pick out there clothes in the morning like me. I dislike their marketing idea because I just have a feeling it wont apeal well to the highschoolers. Everything else is well but that marketing idea just sounds un-appealing. Honestly, I believe marketing to be an important aspect of ones product and without good marketing it could ultimately fail.

    <div class="text">
      I considered this idea because the school blocks literally everthing. To have a tool like this would be a useful way to get a loophole through the schools useless blocking of educational tools. The only reason I disapprove of it is becuase it could get someone into serious trouble. Schools have every right to do what they please with their internet service and if the schools disaproves of the usage of a VPN, it's game over.

    <div class="text">
      I like the idea of games such as these. Mindless and just all over the place is what makes games like this good. Overall the area of its build will be in Roblox and that in general is a good idea since Roblox has all sorts of games on there that people play. Getting people to play it will be easy, but I dislike the fact that this could be similar to a actual simulator game like Goat Simulator. I think for a game to do truly well, it would have to be original or a continuation of a legitimate game series. Such examples are Fortnite which was a new game concept for many(orginal), and Call of Duty which built up on previous games it's had(continuation). Due to the lack of innovation I rejected this game.

    <div class="text">
      In all this project sounds extremely solid. It has a great target, it's non-profit but essentially a useful tool. I really see a lot of potential. However, I think it is going to be difficult to make it known globally. That is because of the amount of tools already similar to it that are far more well known. Google is huge and almost anything even remotely similar to a Google service will not thrive. So, I ultimately rejected it because I feel it will lack in a sense of it being used.

      <div class="text">
	Sounds like a great idea for someone who needs help. However, I think this person has the programming skills to possibly make the quiz but not the training to help people who are having issues. Such a matter should be left to a professional. The only way I see this working is if the person is another student like the creator, who is also a student. Hence, I rejected this idea.
