    <div class="intro">
      Sentient AI has developed rapidly in the last few decades. One could travel 100 years back and ask weather a robot is even possible. Yet, here society is with all this new technology that is always improving. Is this, however, improving us as humans. Well it's quite the contrary, simply no. Although I doubt AI could get as smart as us, AI certainly can lead to the downfall of humans through jobs and laziness. 
    </div>

    <div class="first">
      First topic to focus on is jobs. No matter what one could say, having a job is vital to live. Homelessness is the absolute result if you don't get a job that allows you to live. These machine have the "potential to disrupt our economies, ruin lives throughout several generations"(Kelly, 2020). Everyone currently knows what the Covid pandemic has done to households whose jobs were laid off. Now if predictions by Elon Musk are true, "AI could have an even worse impact on people leaving them with less jobs" since unlike Covid they aren't here temporarily(Kelly, 2020). Not only can it affect jobs, but also the quality of life that working adults get as a result of taxes. As Bill Gates points out we must have some way to tax these robots in the same way we did humans(Kelly, 2020) becuase if we dont we could suffer serious consequences on infrastructure. Overall, we must maintain the control of these AI's and their impact on the economy.

    <div class="second">
      The second point to focus on is the laziness.  The people of the future are at risk of being less phyiscally active and less intteligent(Tverdohleb, 2015). An AI beat Ken Jennings and Gary Kasparov in chess(Tverdohleb, 2015). That alone displays the capabilities of an AI. Still, there is more to thes powerful machines. Another example of machines showing how lazy are humans is the calcultor, and how we use the calculator essentially points it out. These two examples show that AI's have extremely good intelligence and rememberance.  They also cause use to become lazy in a phyisical sense. Such an example is AI's already being used to control complex air traffic as well as planes(Tverdohleb, 2015). Planes controlled by humans require lots of work but with AI's that can do it themselves, theres hardly any work being done to drive planes. Thus, we are getting closer to being lazy. 
    </div>

    <div class="third">
      To finish off it is important that as a group effort we minimize the extent that AI's can go to. Otherwise, not only do we become less intelligent but we also become less physically active. The economy will also take an impact in a way that could destroy lives. So please, continue to make an effort to stop AI from going to an extent that we wont be able to stop in the future.
