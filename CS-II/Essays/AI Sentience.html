      As humans make technological advancements, creations and improvements occur. One of these is AI which is a creation that replicates humans! Over the years it has improved so drastically that it can do human-like tasks. This could then lead to the downfall of humanity.

      It is without a doubt that AI's have intellegence, but there intellegence lacks in some aspects. As said by Metz(2020) mentions it "mimics the brain in only small ways." Which is true since they learn in a way of aquiring information through complex algorithms. Although I have learned math through information the pioneers of math didn't, they didn't just sit in a table and listen to a teacher explaining math concepts. In simple words AI's intellegence is humans own intellegence. This concludes that the downfall of humanity couldn't be that it overtakes us but rather it does our jobs.

    <div class="second">
      An article written by Jack Kelly(2020) for Forbes states that, "This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs." How could creating new jobs possibly be bad in the technology industry? Well technology is just one of many industries, and with AI's taking peoples jobs this could cause oversaturation in the tech industry. There would eventually be no space left and with other industries being taken, people could lose everything they own. Homelessness would rise up in ways never seen before. Well humanity is still alive and well, so who cares.

    <div class="third">
      Indeed we'll be alive, but not well. Disney made an interesting film called WALL-E. Looking into it shows how humans have made AI do their jobs. In the film it got to the point were people became extremely obese, so obese that they sit in chairs and depend on AI. Now although it is a bit unrealistic that it could go that far, the point is that people become "less physically active" as Vlad Tverdohleb(2015) brought out. With people who aren't in good health comes disease's such as diabetes. Vaccums robots are an example of laziness. Vaccuming your house is not even that difficult, yet some are so lazy they buy the machines that do it for them. Truly laziness can become a major problem if not fixed.

    <div class="fifth">
      Although it might not go to the extremes thar WALL-E went to, AI could lead to the downfall of humanity through the replacing of jobs that people once consumed.
