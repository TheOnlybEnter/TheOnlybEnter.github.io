      In simple words bias is being in favor of one thing over another and being unreasonable. During my research of the types of Biases, I have discovered the five that I need to fix. These five are Experience Bias, Attentional Bias, Commitment Bias, The False Consensus Effect, and the Self Serving Bias. Each of these biases I have seen affected my decisions and mindset. 
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      First is the <b> Experience Bias </b>. The best explanation I found for this was described by Legacy LifePoint Health(2021), it occurs "when we forget that our truth is not always the only option." Although I am the only one working on this project, I have realized that what appeals to me as correct decisions("truth") may not appeal to others as correct. I am making a website for a store but I lacked what could appeal to the audience. The way I have tackled this is the same way Legacy LifePoint Health(2021) says, by having "others to check" my thinking. By doing this I learn that I can draw from other peoples perspectives and apply them to my project rather than this. So far I have been experimenting with different choices seperately and this rsults in me learning that there is more out there than what I want. 
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The second bias I took note of is <b>Attentional Bias</b>. Although this has yet to occur, I do not doubt that it can happen to me. As Kendra Cherry,a consultant on physcology, puts it "this is the tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others."(Cherry, 2022) This is important when making decisions cause if one small thing is not considered, the entirety of the choice can fall. In a podcast by Hiddenbrain the interviewer(Shankar Vedantam) and the interviewee(Wendy Smith) both discussed a company that was once well established but went bankrupt. To breifly summarize Polaroid is what the name is, a camera that prints pictures right after taking them. The story goes that the inventor, Land, had a daughter Jennifer who he took a picture of and wanted it "to see that picture immediately"(Hiddenbrain, 2022). This resulted in the instant camera. As descirbed by the interview, Polaroid was one of those "big oil tankers" having a "75% market share"(Hiddenbrain, 2022). However, when the transition to digital cameras came they failed ultimately. Wendy describes it as "rather than capturing the market, they got stuck in their existing strategy"(Hiddenbrain, 2022). They had gathered "70% of their profit just on the film" which is what ultimately affected them.(Hiddenbrain, 2022) The film issue is what Wendy descibed as them getting "stuck in their exisiting strategy", and film did not have anything to do with digital cameras. This can even happen to me, I might have started an idea for my project but might have to switch gears. I have learned that to avoid <b>Attentional Bias</b> I can't get stuck on a existing plan and try to merge it with a new one. 
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The third bias is <b> Commitment Bias</b>. <b> Commitment Bias </b> is defined as once "we have committed to something, we double down and continue to commit to it over time(Hiddenbrain, 2022)", or in my words sticking to a choice even if it results poorly. Like the previous paragraph I have yet to do this, regardless it's important for future reference. Refering to the Hiddenbrain podcast again Wendy and Shankar were talking about the situation with USA and Iraq's so called "weapons of mass destruction". This issue is quite well known, it was a matter of "do we go to war? Do we not go to war? And once we have decided to go to war, how do we then reinforce"(Hiddenbrain, 2022). As the war went on progressing it became known to the media that they "had not found clear evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction" and this is the first sign of the <b> Commitment Bias </b>. At that point the US government was screwed but "added troops over time to that war", which fully shows the bias the US government had. This is a bias that is quite difficult to avoid or stop. As a research article by The Decision Lab(2022) brought out there is a "fear of shaking things up" which causes many to stay commited with there actions. This happens because people are fearful of failure, when really we should ask ourselves "why worry about that"(The Decision Lab, 2022)? So, for my part I have decided that in order to avoid <b> Commitment Bias</b> I must be willing to change. If I can't change then I have essentially trapped myself in the same situation that the USA did with Iraq.

    <div class="paragraph">
      The fourth bias is considered a cognitive bias, this is the <b>False Consensus Effect</b>. In an article by Charlotte Nickerson she describes it as "the tendency to see our own attitudes, beliefs and behavior as being typical"(Nickerson, 2022). There are a few ways it can occur. One I noticed the most is "in order to feel good about ourselves, we are motivated to think that other people are just like us"(Cherry, 2020). It is essentially overestimating how much others think alike to us. This bias goes so far to the point where you think your choices are right in others viewpoint, and it results in you not seeing the fault in your choices. Although this bias and <b>Experience Bias</b> are somewhat similar, <b>Experience Bias</b> doesn't give the false idea that people think the way you do. Although their definitions are a little different, the solutions are similar. To avoid <b>False Consensus Effect</b> you could simply consider the others viewpoint. When doing my project I have to avoid overestimating the chances my audience will like my choices.

    <div class="paragraph">
      The final bias I found is the <b>Self Serving Bias</b>. An article by Healthline puts it as "taking credit for positive events or outcomes, but blaming outside factors for negative events"(Healthline, 2018). I've seen this in myself when solving an algorithm. Usually when solving something like the Merge-Sort I just could not do that alone. I used websites that explained it and while I understood it, implementing it in code was confusing. I had to use pseduo-code to do it and then took the credit for myself once it functioned. The truth is that the website is to credit for it's functioning, not me. I even showed the ladder part to the definition, by blaming the code for not working. To avoid this I have to give credit were it is due and learn from my mistakes. The name certainly fits because I did get what I deserved when trying to understand how the code functioned, eventually I understood it.
