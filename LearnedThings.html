    <p class="subheadings"> Learning C language <p>
    <p> Now I didn't learn a huge amount of the C language but I did get on some things down. Overall based on what I learned it's overwhelming.
      <br> Like when you look at swift it's so simple but like C doesn't have a built in string func. Instead you gotta use arrays. <br>
      Then the SEMI-COLONS, the #*&@!#% SEMI-COLONS I spent like three hours figuring out why this func didn't even work and it was because of a semi-colon.
      <br> There is a lot to specify in the langauge which I find hard but I will probably get used to it eventually. <br>
